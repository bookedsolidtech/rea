# /codex-review — Adversarial Review via Codex

Invokes the Codex plugin (`/codex:adversarial-review`) on the current branch's diff, captures the result, and records it to the REA audit log. Adversarial review by an independent model (GPT-5.4) is a **first-class, non-optional step** in the REA engineering process — it is the counterweight to Opus-authored code.

## Why this exists

The default workflow in REA is Plan → Build → Review, with the Review leg handed to a different model than the one that wrote the code. Codex adversarial review is free, fast, and independent — it catches the mistakes the authoring model is most likely to miss: security assumptions, correctness under edge cases, and logical gaps in tests. Treat it with the same weight as a human second set of eyes.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` (optional) — diff target, same semantics as `/review`. Defaults to `main`.

## Preflight

1. Read `.rea/policy.yaml` — confirm autonomy is at least L1
2. Check `.rea/HALT` — if present, stop and report FROZEN
3. Verify the Codex plugin is installed. If `/codex` is not available in this Claude Code install, report: "Codex plugin not installed. See https://github.com/openai/codex for install steps." and stop.

## Step 1 — Resolve the diff target

Same logic as `/review`:

- Empty `$ARGUMENTS` → `main`
- Otherwise → use the provided ref

Capture:

- Current branch name (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`)
- Head SHA (`git rev-parse HEAD`)
- Diff target SHA (`git rev-parse <target>`)
- Commit log from target to HEAD

If the diff is empty, stop and report: "No changes to review against `<target>`."

## Step 2 — Delegate to codex-adversarial agent

Invoke the `codex-adversarial` agent with:

- The diff target and head SHA
- The branch name
- The commit log summary
- The full diff text

The agent wraps `/codex:adversarial-review` and returns structured findings.

## Step 3 — Verify audit entry — REQUIRED

The `codex-adversarial` agent **MUST** emit an audit entry for every invocation. This is the same contract documented in `agents/codex-adversarial.md` Step 4 and matches the runtime behavior of `rea hook push-gate` (which always calls `appendAuditRecord` on a completed review — see `src/hooks/push-gate/index.ts`'s `EVT_REVIEWED` path).

Verify the entry was written:

```bash
tail -n 1 .rea/audit.jsonl
```

The expected entry has `tool_name: "codex.review"`, `server_name: "codex"`, and `metadata` containing `head_sha`, `target`, `finding_count`, and `verdict`. If the entry is missing, the review **did not complete its contract** — surface that to the user as a failure.

**Why audit emission is required even though the pre-push gate is stateless:** the 0.11.0 push-gate decides pass/fail on Codex's live verdict, not on a receipt in the audit log — but the audit record is still the operator's only forensic trail for an interactive `/codex-review` run. Without it, "did this review actually happen" becomes unanswerable, which is exactly the failure mode helixir flagged across rounds 65/66/73 in the 0.13–0.17 cycle. Runtime always emits; the agent always emits; the slash command verifies. Three checkpoints, one contract.

(Earlier docs in 0.15+ said this step was "optional"; that wording contradicted both the agent's Step 4 and the runtime behavior of `safeAppend` in `src/hooks/push-gate/index.ts`. Reconciled in 0.18.0 — helixir Finding #6 across cycles 1–7.)

## Step 4 — Report

Print a summary:

```
/codex-review — <branch> vs <target>
Head SHA:    <SHA>
Verdict:     pass | concerns | blocking
Findings:    <total>
Audit:       .rea/audit.jsonl:<entry-index>

<grouped findings>
```

If the verdict is `blocking`, state plainly: "Do not merge until the blocking findings are addressed."

## Pre-merge usage

This command is the **interactive** Codex adversarial review. The **pre-push** gate at `rea hook push-gate` runs Codex independently on every push — you do not need to run `/codex-review` to "prime" the push-gate. The two are complementary:

- `/codex-review` — rich, interactive review output in the chat. Use during implementation to catch issues early, at review checkpoints, or whenever you want Codex's read on a specific diff.
- `rea hook push-gate` (wired to `.husky/pre-push`) — fresh Codex review on every push. If Codex surfaces blocking/concerns findings, the push exits 2; Claude reads `.rea/last-review.json`, fixes, and pushes again.

## Constraints

- Read-only with respect to source files. Writes only to `.rea/audit.jsonl` (via middleware).
- Never silently fails. If Codex is unavailable, unresponsive, or returns an error, surface it to the user and record the failure in audit.
- Never retries automatically on non-deterministic Codex errors — surface and let the user decide.
