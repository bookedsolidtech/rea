# shellcheck shell=bash
# hooks/_lib/cmd-segments.sh — shell-segment splitting for Bash-tier hooks.
#
# Background: hooks that gate `Bash` tool calls grep `.tool_input.command`
# for danger words (`rm -rf`, `git restore`, `pnpm install`, etc.). Pre-
# 0.15.0 every hook ran a single `grep -qE PATTERN "$cmd"` against the
# whole command string. That false-positives on heredoc bodies and
# commit messages where the trigger word appears inside content rather
# than as a command:
#
#   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
#   docs: explain why we don't run rm -rf node_modules in CI
#   EOF
#   )"
#
# The unanchored regex matches `rm -rf` inside the heredoc body and the
# hook blocks a perfectly safe commit. Hit during the 2026-05-03 session
# repeatedly — the pattern that motivated dependency-audit-gate's 0.15.0
# segment-split fix.
#
# This helper exposes two primitives every Bash-tier hook should use:
#
#   for_each_segment "$CMD" CALLBACK
#     Splits $CMD on shell command separators (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`,
#     newlines) and invokes CALLBACK with each segment as $1, plus the
#     leading-prefix-stripped form as $2 (with `sudo`/`exec`/`time`/
#     `then`/`do`/env-var-assignment prefixes removed). Returns 0 if
#     CALLBACK returned 0 for every segment, or the first non-zero
#     CALLBACK exit otherwise.
#
#   any_segment_matches "$CMD" PATTERN
#     Iterates segments and returns 0 if any segment's prefix-stripped
#     form matches PATTERN (a `grep -qiE` extended regex). Returns 1
#     if no segment matches.
#
# Quoting awareness: the splitter is NOT quote-aware. A separator inside
# a quoted string would be split. This is INTENTIONAL and SAFE: the
# segments-vs-callback contract is "find segments that anchor on a
# trigger word." Over-splitting produces extra segments that don't
# anchor; they're ignored. Under-splitting (treating a quoted separator
# as part of one segment) is what the original bug was. The trade-off
# explicitly accepts over-splitting.
#
# Quoting note for future maintainers: do not "fix" the over-splitting
# without breaking the security property. Quote-aware splitting in pure
# bash is a real lift; if needed it should move to a Node helper.

# Split $1 on shell command separators. Emits one segment per line on
# stdout (empty segments preserved). Used by both higher-level helpers
# below; not generally called by hooks directly.
_rea_split_segments() {

  # GNU sed and BSD sed both honor `s/PATTERN/\n/g` with `-E` for ERE.
  # We use printf+sed instead of bash IFS=$'...' read so the splitter
  # behaves identically across BSD and GNU sed.
  #
  # 0.16.0 codex P1 fix (helix-015 #3): the prior sed split on bare `|`
  # which broke bash's `>|` (noclobber-override redirect) into two
  # segments — `printf x >` then ` .rea/HALT`. The redirect detector
  # then never saw a complete `>|` operator and the bash-gate let the
  # write through.
  #
  # 0.16.0 codex P2-1 fix: the placeholder must NOT collide with any
  # legal byte the agent could supply. The earlier `\x01` (SOH) is a
  # legal UTF-8 byte and rare-but-possible in commands; if a payload
  # contained `\x01` literally, the third sed pass would manufacture
  # a `>|` operator that wasn't in the original — corrupting downstream
  # parsing in either fail-open or fail-closed directions depending on
  # what came after. The new sentinel `__REA_GTPIPE_a8f2c1__` is
  # multi-byte alphanumeric, impossible to collide with shell input
  # under any encoding we care about (any agent that intentionally
  # included this string would already be obviously trying to confuse
  # the splitter — and even then, the worst case is fail-closed).
