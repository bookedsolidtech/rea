# routed the body through a file the regex never read. We now resolve the
# named flag's path argument(s), read up to 64 KiB of each (cap covers
# realistic issue bodies; a multi-megabyte body is suspicious in itself),

# skipped — the hook's stdin is the tool payload, not the issue body,
# and re-reading is impossible. Files outside REA_ROOT (resolved via

CORRECT DISCLOSURE PATH:
1. Use GitHub Security Advisories (private):
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories --method POST --input - <<'JSON'
   { \"summary\": \"...\", \"description\": \"...\", \"severity\": \"medium|high|critical\",
     \"vulnerabilities\": [{\"package\": {\"name\": \"@pkg\", \"ecosystem\": \"npm\"}}] }

2. Or navigate to: Security tab → Advisories → 'Report a vulnerability'
3. Or email security@bookedsolid.tech (see SECURITY.md)

The finding will be publicly disclosed AFTER a patch is released (coordinated disclosure).

WHY: Public issues expose vulnerabilities before users can patch. This is enforced by the
security-disclosure-gate hook (REA_DISCLOSURE_MODE=${DISCLOSURE_MODE}).

If this is NOT a security vulnerability, rephrase the issue to avoid triggering
security patterns, then retry."
